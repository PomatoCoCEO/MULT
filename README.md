# Implementation of the destructive phase of the JPEG algorithm

## 1st Project of the Multimedia course of the Bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering from the University of Coimbra

The algorithms involved in JPEG compression were implemented in python and saved in the Jupyter report file, and in other .py files.
The code was tested with a small image dataset, also included in the repository.
